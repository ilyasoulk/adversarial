def reward_model(code, unit_tests):
    '''
    This function should take in a code snippet and a list of unit tests.
    It should return a score that represents how well the code snippet.
    The score is yet to be defined.
    I assume the score will depend on 2 things:
    1. Are there any syntax errors in the code snippet ?
    2. Does the code snippet pass all the unit tests ?
    The score should take into account both of these factors.
